                    series of exhibitions about people who were
                    forced to leave their homelands.
                    The first exhibition was held in the Parisian
                    Catacombs, the second under a bridge
                    in Vienna, and the third in a 24-hour kiosk

                    and convey their experiences to a European
                    audience. The unusual venues were chosen

                    settled in their new home. To survive, they
                    must perform feats akin to Hercules while
                    also being as vulnerable as a newly emerged
                    butterfly. This state can be described as being
                    “Between Hercules and a Butterfly.”</p>

                    native culture while being quoted by a new
                    one. They face the depression of losing their

                    friends and home while navigating new chal-
                    lenges everyday. Exhausted, they struggle

                    with daily tasks but must continue to work

                    their new life.</p>

                            of Paris is a point between life and no life. Feeling
                            undead, this border state resembles where we find
                            ourselves once we move to a new country.
                            Catacombs, technical rooms or sewers are hidden
                            from everyday life. The difficulties of immigrant life
                            are hidden in the same way.</p>

                <p>I organize not just an event, but more like a ritual. <br>
                    My responsibility is to invent the form and the concept 
                    of the exhibition, find a place and artists, invite audience 
                    and journalists, look for photographers and videographers, 
                    make posters and presentations, and install everything by
                    myself including lights and works. After all that I write text
                    as an allergic reaction to what has happened.</p>
                    <p>And all that works is only for not more than 2 hours of the
                        show like a film duration </p>

            <p>Each work in the catacombs acquired a new additional meaning.<br>
                For example, architect Boris Bernaskoni’s small ceramic house in the endless
                space of the catacombs became an image of a lost home, the work is called
                a house for bedbugs, an ironic name for the time (it was a period of bedbug
                infestation in Paris, which coincided with the moment of mass immigration
                of people from Ukraine and Russia). As well as a video art by Jenia Filatova
                with flower-people, which by nature are very glossy and perfect in this case
                were projected onto the ceiling and merged with the expressive texture
                of the place, perfect skin covered with cracks and began to ossify.</p>
            <p>If making of this exhibition felt like a wild venture, the exhibition itself looked
                like a ritual. It was wonderful to see how the eyes of the people and artists
                who came were lit up.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that the sewer manhole that served as the entrance to the
                exhibition was open the whole time, the police did not arrive.</p>
            <p>Thus began the series of exhibitions ‘Between Hercules and the Butterfly’.</p>
